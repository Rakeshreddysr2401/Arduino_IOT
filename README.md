# Arduino_IOT
Arduino is an open source electronics platform based on easy to use hardware and software.\
Arduino boards are able to read inputs lights on a sensor,a finger on a button,or a twitter message and turn it into an output -activating a motor ,turing on a led ,publishing something online.

##why arduino ?
-> Over the years arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments.\
-> Inexpensive.\
-> Cross platform works on windows.\
-> Simple clear programming environment.
-> Open-source Hardware empowering user to build them Independently adapt them their particular needs.\
-> It acts like brain and shelids act like body parts all combine it works to do any thing as an entity.\

**some the usefull sensors and sheilds are**\
Temperatue sensor DHT11.\
Humidity Sensor.\
Ultra-Sonic sensor(used to find distance).\
Tracking module(to track).\
Tilt Switch and LDR (commonly used in bikes).\
Heartbeat Sensor.\
Buzzer.\
Joysticks.\
Relay Module.\

Not also these there are many sensors and modules which are avalible to us to use.
